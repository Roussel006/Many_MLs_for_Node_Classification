    "# Section 2: Experiments with Deep Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we build five Deep Learning models, using **Tensorflow**. Later, we will see how to build the same models to PyTorch and learn how to translate models between Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2a. A simple dense model: with only pooling layer between the input and the output layers.\n",
    "    2b. A deeper model with more layers\n",
    "    2c. An Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "    2d. An RNN with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n",
    "    2e. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Dataset** we will use is the CiteSeer Dataset and classify the documents or the nodes. This dataset is a popular benchmark for Graph-based MLs. As of January 2025, the best accuracy achieved is **82.07 ± 1.04** by [\"ACMII-Snowball-2\"](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/is-heterophily-a-real-nightmare-for-graph). A live update on the rankings can be found in this [link](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/node-classification-on-citeseer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we beat it? Perhaps not so easily, as brilliant ML scientists and engineers have already thrown the kitchen sink at it. But we can definitely try! Why not dream? We will see how close we can get.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information within the dataset: This dataset contains a set of 3327 scientific papers represented by binary vectors of 3703 words, with the values represent the presence or absence of the words in the document. A **key feature** of the dataset is that it also contains data on the citations among the papers as a citation graph or network, along with the text data. Here we are only use the text data. In later sections, we will incorporate the Graph data and see how it changes things. The availability of both types of data is the biggest reason we picked this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The General Plan**:\n",
    "1. <u>Build our Deep Learning models</u>: For each model, we will set up all layers between the inputs and the outputs. Some layers after the input layer may be for processing the text data and convert them to numbers -- such as, tokenizing/vectorizing and embedding. Then, we may have a convolutional or a recurrent layer. We may as well have pooling in between to reduce dimensionality of the vectors. Finally, as a we have a multi-class classification at hand, we will use the softmax function at the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <u>Train, Validate, and Test</u>: After training, we will check the validation and the test accuracies. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. <u>Save the Models</u>: We will then save the models so that we can call them up again in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is almost as simple as it sounds. Of course, there are some nuances to these methods. But, we do not need to worry too much about it now. We will discuss things as they become necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a big thanks to [Daniel Bourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke) for his awesome, student-friendly courses on Deep Learning, which helped me a lot in building the models in this section. Please consider taking his courses if you want a more detailed understanding of the deep learning models here.\n",

The tokens allows us to represent the docs as vectors with the dimensions of words or their tokens. A related step we complete here is to \"pad\" the vectors, which simply makes the vectors the same size, by adding zeros to the end. Please see the below printout for an example. The tokenized vectors would be then used to create embeddings, which we look into in the next section.\n",

We tried using Tensorflow's tokenizer function to tokenize, but it did not work so well with our one-hot encoded data. It was easier to do the tokenizing ourselves than trying to fix it.\n",

    "We see that we could not much better than the shallow ML methods. Of course, it is possible that a different network architecture could yield improvements, but it seems improbable as we tested quite a few types of models by now without seeing a gain. Possible reasons are that (1) the limited amount of training data we used and (2) the lack of information about the text contents in the documents, as our information only includes the presence or the absence of a word. We do not even have the counts of the words or the sequence in which the words occur in. Therefore, it seems that there is not enough information for our deep learning models to find \"deep\" and complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will incorporate the \"citation network\" (i.e., the edges between the documents) as additional information and see how it improves things. We will also turn off and on the two datastreams and see what happens, as a sort of an ablation study. Let's go then!\n"
